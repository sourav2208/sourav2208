##⚠️ Warning: This Repo May Cause Mild Nostalgia & Major Cringe ##
👋 Hello curious recruiter/hacker/human!

So you clicked the GitHub link from my resume... and landed in the land of chaos —
This was my "Sab kuch yahin daal do, GitHub toh folder hai na?" phase. 🙈

Yes, I admit:

I used to dump all projects here like a Sunday laundry basket 🧺

Everything was here — messy, proud, and innocent

GitHub was just a “save online” button for me 😅

##💡 Fast forward to 2025... ##
I discovered:

Repositories can be individual 👀

READMEs can be readable 📖

And GitHub is not Google Drive 😐

## 🚀 Now I’m organized, smarter, and drinking more coffee than ever. 
Come see my glow-up here:

## 🤔 Why didn’t I delete this?
Because every superhero has an origin story.
And this repo?
This is mine. 🦸
